# JavaScript Role-Playing Game (RPG) Practice Project

## Introduction

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that enables interactive web experiences. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this practice project, I developed a simple Role-Playing Game (RPG) to strengthen fundamental JavaScript skills. By building this game, I gain hands-on experience with key programming concepts, including:

- Variables and Data Types
- Arrays and Objects
- Strings and Functions
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Event Handling
- DOM Manipulation

## Features

- **Character Creation:** Players can create and name their own characters.
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Implement attack and defense mechanics using JavaScript logic.
- **Inventory System:** Manage weapons, potions, and other items.
- **Enemy Encounters:** Randomly generate enemies for players to battle.
- **Game Progression:** Track player stats, health, and experience points.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
